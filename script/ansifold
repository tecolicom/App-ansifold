=head1 VERSION

Version 1.33

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ansifold> is a L<fold(1)> compatible command utilizing
L<Text::ANSI::Fold> module, which enables to handle ANSI terminal
sequences.

B<ansicolrm> works like L<colrm(1)> command.  This is an alias for
B<ansifold> command and works exactly same except option B<--colrm> is
enabled by default.

B<ansicut> works like L<cut(1)> command. This is an alias for
B<ansifold> command and works exactly same except default output
separator string is set as empty by default.  Support only B<-c> (or
B<--cut>) option of the original L<cut(1)> command.

=head2 FOLD BY WIDTH

B<ansifold> folds lines in 72 column by default.  Use option B<-w> to
change the folding width.

    $ ansifold -w132

Single field is used repeatedly for the same line.

With option B<--padding>, remained columns are filled by padding
character, space by default, or specified by optional value like
C<--padding=_>.  Default padding character can be set by B<--padchar>
option.

B<ansifold> handles Unicode multi-byte characters properly.  Option
B<--ambiguous> takes I<wide> or I<narrow> and it specifies the visual
width of Unicode ambiguous characters.

If the last character is full-width and must be wrapped in the middle
of it, it is wrapped just before the character.  If padding is
specified, then one padding character is inserted.  If you really want
to keep the wrapping position, use the C<--stripwide> option.

=head2 TERMINAL WIDTH and CALCULATION

If the width argument begins with C<=>, it is interpreted as an RPN
(Reverse Polish Notation) expression with the terminal width as the
initial value.  Therefore,

    ansifold -w=

will wrap at the width of the terminal, and

    ansifold -w=2/

will wrap at half the width of the terminal.

=head2 MULTIPLE WIDTH

Unlike the original fold(1) command, multiple numbers can be
specified.

    $ LANG=C date | ansifold -w 3,1,3,1,2 | cat -n
         1  Wed
         2   
         3  Dec
         4   
         5  19

With multiple fields, unmatched part is discarded as in the above
example.  So you can truncate lines by putting comma at the end of
single field.

    ansifold -w80,

Option C<-w80,> is equivalent to C<-w80,0>.  Zero width is ignored
when seen as a final number, but not ignored otherwise.

If the data is shorter and there is no corresponding string for the
field, an empty string is returned.  If the padding option is
specified, the field is padded to the given width.

=head2 NEGATIVE WIDTH

Negative number fields are discarded.

    $ LANG=C date | ansifold -w 3,-1,3,-1,2
    Wed
    Dec
    19

If the final width is negative, it is not discarded but takes all the
rest instead.  So next commands do the same thing.

    $ colrm 7 10

    $ ansifold -nw 6,-4,-1

Option C<--width -1> does nothing effectively.  Using it with
B<--expand> option implements ANSI/Unicode aware L<expand(1)> command.

    $ ansifold --expand --width -1

This can be written as this.

    $ ansifold -xw-1

=head2 NUMBERS

Number description is handled by L<Getopt::EX::Numbers> module, and
consists of C<start>, C<end>, C<step> and C<length> elements.  For
example,

    $ echo AABBBBCCCCCCDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEE | ansifold -w 2:10:2

is equivalent to:

    $ echo AABBBBCCCCCCDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEE | ansifold -w 2,4,6,8,10

and produces output like this:

    AA
    BBBB
    CCCCCC
    DDDDDDDD
    EEEEEEEEEE

=head2 SEPARATOR/TERMINATOR

Option B<-n> eliminates newlines between columns.

    $ LANG=C date | ansifold -w 3,-1,3,-1,2 -n
    WedDec19

Option B<--separate> set the output separator string.

    $ echo ABCDEF | ansifold --separate=: -w 1,0,1,0,1,-1
    A::B::C:DEF

Option B<-n> is a short-cut for C<--separate ''>.

Option B<--paragraph> (or B<-p>) print extra newline after each line.
This is convenient when a paragraph is made up of single line, like
microsoft word document.  The B<-p> option can be repeated multiple
times and will output that many newline characters.

=head2 PREFIX

=head3 B<--prefix>=I<string>

If a string is given by B<--prefix> option, that string is inserted at
the beginning of each folded text.  This is convenient to produce
indented text block.  Because the first line is not affected, insert
appropiate prefix if necessary.  Originally made for
L<App::Greple::frame> module.

=head3 B<--autoindent>=I<pattern>

An experimental B<--autoindent> option takes a regex pattern for the
indent label, and set the prefix string as a space string of that
label length.  For example, command C<ps auxgw> produce very long line
output and you may want to fold C<COMMAND> portion with appropiate
indentation.  In this case use B<--autoindent> option like this:

    $ ps axgw | ansifold --autoindent '.*TIME (?=COMMAND)' -w= --boundary=word
      PID   TT  STAT      TIME COMMAND
        1   ??  Ss   817:25.87 /sbin/launchd
      354   ??  S      4:30.01 /System/Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/
                               MacOS/TextEdit
      522   ??  Ss     2:50.67 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Uninstall.
                               framework/Resources/uninstalld

=head3 B<--keepindent>

If the C<--keepindent> option is specified, the string matched by
C<--autoindent> is inserted at the beginning of the line rather than
indenting with spaces.

=head2 REFILL

=head3 B<--refill>, B<-r>

Option B<--refill> (or B<-r>) makes the command to run in paragraph
mode, which read consecutive non-blank lines at once, and join them
into single line before processing.  So all paragraphs are reformatted
by new text width.  You can use this with B<--autoindent> option.

When joining lines, newlines between full-width characters (Japanese,
Chinese) are simply removed without adding space.  Korean (Hangul) is
treated like ASCII text and joined with space.

Option B<-rw-1> will just fill paragraphs without reformatting.

=head3 B<--crmode>

Option B<--crmode> is designed to work with L<App::Greple::tee>
module's B<--crmode> option.  It does the following:

=over 4

=item *

Joins text separated by carriage return (CR) characters.  For ASCII
text, CR is replaced with a space.  For full-width characters (e.g.,
Japanese and Chinese), CR between them is simply removed without
adding space.  Korean (Hangul) is treated like ASCII text and joined
with space.

=item *

Sets the output separator to CR (equivalent to C<--separate '\r'>),
so that the folded lines are separated by CR instead of newline.
This allows tee's B<--crmode> to convert them back to newlines.

=back

Example with L<App::Greple::tee>:

    greple -Mtee ansifold -sw80 --crmode -- --crmode ...

=head1 LINE BREAKING

Line break adjustment is supported for ASCII word boundaries.  As for
Japanese, more complicated prohibition processing is performed.  Use
option B<-s> to enable everything.

=head2 B<--boundary>=I<word>|I<space>

This option prohibit breaking line in the middle of ASCII/Latin word.
Context of word is defined by option value; I<word> means
alpha-numeric sequence, while I<space> means simply non-space
printables.

=head2 B<--linebreak>=I<all>|I<runin>|I<runout>|I<none>, B<--lb>=...

Option B<--linebreak> takes a value of I<all>, I<runin>, I<runout> or
I<none>.  Default value is I<none>.

When B<--linebreak> option is enabled, if the cut-off text start with
space or prohibited characters (e.g. closing parenthesis), they are
ran-in at the end of current line as much as possible.

If the trimmed text end with prohibited characters (e.g. opening
parenthesis), they are ran-out to the head of next line, provided it
fits to maximum width.

=head2 B<--runin>=I<width>, B<--runout>=I<width>

=head2 B<--runlen>=I<width>

Maximum width of run-in/run-out characters are defined by B<--runin>
and B<--runout> option.  Default values are 4.

Option B<--runlen> set both run-in/run-out width at once.

=head2 B<--margin>=I<width>

Option B<--margin> specifies the right margin width.  The value is
subtracted from the folding width.  This is useful when you want to
leave some space on the right side of the output.  For example:

    $ ansifold -w80 --margin=10

will fold text at column 70 (80 - 10), leaving 10 columns of margin on
the right.

When used with B<--runin>, the margin provides extra space for run-in
characters.  Characters that would normally appear at the beginning of
the next line (such as closing punctuation) can be pulled into the
margin area of the current line.  This allows the visible text to stay
within the intended width while accommodating Japanese line-break
rules.

=head2 B<--splitwide>[=I<lefthalf>[I<righthalf>]]

If it becomes necessary to break in the middle of a wide character,
split the character into left and right half.  Replacement characters
are C<\N{LEFT HALF BLACK CIRCLE}> (C<◖>) and C<\N{RIGHT HALF BLACK
CIRCLE}> (C<◗>) by default.

If a parameter is given, the first character is used as the left half.
The next character, if any, is used as the right half, otherwise the
first character is used.

=head2 B<--smart>, B<-s>

Option B<--smart> (or simply B<-s>) set both B<--boundary=word> and
B<--linebreak=all>, and enables all smart text formatting capability.

Use option B<--boundary=space> if you want the command to behave more
like B<-s> option of L<fold(1)> command.

=head1 TAB EXPANSION

=head2 B<--expand>

Option B<--expand> (or B<-x>) enables tab character expansion.

    $ ansifold --expand

Takes optional number for tabstop and it precedes to B<--tabstop>
option.

    $ ansifold -x4w-1

If the command is executed with the name C<ansiexpand>, it works as if
the B<--expand> option were given, and set default folding width to
-1.  L<App::ansiexpand> is a bit more sophisticated and we recommend
using that one rather.

=head2 B<--tabhead>, B<--tabspace>

Each tab character is converted to B<tabhead> and following
B<tabspace> characters (both are space by default).  They can be
specified by B<--tabhead> and B<--tabspace> option.  If the option
value is longer than single characger, it is evaluated as unicode
name.  Next example makes tab character visible keeping text layout.

    $ ansifold --expand --tabhead="MEDIUM SHADE" --tabspace="LIGHT SHADE"

=head2 B<--tabstyle>

Option B<--tabstyle> allow to set B<--tabhead> and B<--tabspace>
characters at once according to the given style name.  Select from
C<dot>, C<symbol> or C<shade>.  Styles are defined in
L<Text::ANSI::Fold> library.

    $ ansifold --expand --tabstyle=shade

=head1 COLRM COMPATIBLE

=head2 B<--colrm> [ I<start> [ I<end> ] ... ]

Option B<--colrm> takes L<colrm(1)> command compatible arguments.

Since the output separator string is not set, use the B<-n> option to
get the same result as the L<colrm(1)> command; when invoked as
B<ansicolrm> command, the separator string is set to the empty by
default.

Next command behave exactly like C<colrm start end> and takes care of
ANSI terminal sequences.

    $ ansifold -n --colrm start end

    $ ansicolrm start end

Unlike standard L<colrm(1)>, I<start> and I<end> can be repeated as
many times as desired.  Next command removes column 1-3 and 7-9, and
produces C<4560> as a result.

    $ echo 1234567890 | ansifold -n --colrm 1 3 7 9
           ^^^   ^^^

=head1 CUT COMPATIBLE

=head2 B<--cut> list ...

=head2 B<-c> list ...

Option B<--cut> (or B<-c>) takes L<cut(1)> command compatible
arguments.

Since the output separator string is set, use the B<-n> option to get
the same result as the L<cut(1)> command; when invoked as B<ansicut>
command, the separator string is set to the empty by default.

Next command behave exactly like C<cut -c list> and takes care of ANSI
terminal sequences.

    $ ansifold -n -c list ...

    $ ansicut -c list ...

Next command retrieve column 4-6,9- and produces C<45690> as a result.

    $ echo 1234567890 | ansifold -nc 4-6,9-
              ^^^  ^^

Unlike L<cut(1)>'s B<-c> option, parameter number is taken as screen
columns of the terminal, rather than number of logical characters.
